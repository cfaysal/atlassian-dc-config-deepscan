# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The version of the endpoint is
declared once, as `Pc.VERSION`, and printed by every output channel.

## 0.1 - unreleased

First working version.

### Added

- Project picker and a bookmarkable per-project report at
  `/rest/scriptrunner/latest/custom/projectConfig`.
- Full recursive scan of a project: issue type scheme, issue type screen scheme down to
  screen, tab and field, field configuration scheme down to per-field behaviour, custom
  field contexts with options and defaults, workflow scheme with every layer and each
  workflow's statuses and transitions, permission, notification and issue security schemes
  down to the resolved grant, project roles with actors, versions and components.
- Jira Service Management detected at runtime; on an instance without it the section says
  so rather than being empty.
- HTML, JSON and CSV output. The HTML page carries a tree view and a flat table view of the
  same data and switches between them without another request.
- Confluence page export over a Jira application link, staged behind its button, with a
  Remark column that belongs to the administrator and is carried over verbatim. If that
  read fails, nothing is written.
- Deep link per node, every link shape backed by primary evidence read out of a running
  instance. The one shape that could not be evidenced carries no link and says so.
- Offline test suite compiled together with the Jira-free classes cut out of the endpoint
  itself, plus CI: parse check, suite, credential scan, and a check that application links
  are used only inside the declared transport section.
